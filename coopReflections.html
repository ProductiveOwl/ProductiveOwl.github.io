        <h3>Coop Term 2 - CRA</h3>
        <p class="date">September - December 2024</p>
        <div class="border">
          <h4>About the Company</h4>
          <p>For my second coop term, I continued to work at the Canada Revenue Agency. As an agency under the federal
            government of
            Canada, the CRA is in charge of all taxes and benefits for Canadians.
          <blockquote><i>The CRA’s mission is to “Administer tax, benefits, and related programs, and ensure compliance
              on
              behalf of governments across Canada, thereby contributing to the ongoing economic and social well-being of
              Canadians.”
            </i></blockquote>
          As this term is a continuation of my previous coop term, I continued working as an IT developer on a front-end
          application.
          </p>

        <script src="https://creattie.com/js/embed.js?id=3f6954fde297cd31b441" defer></script>
          <h4>Goals</h4>
          <p>Based on my work and feedback from my last work term, I wanted to improve my knowledge of the CRA systems
            and my communication skills with other teams. My goals included improving my teamwork, informational
            literacy,
            and problem-solving skills.</p>
          <h4 class="goalTitle">1) Teamwork - Learning to work on larger issues with multiple people.</h4>
          <p>During this second work term, I have worked on larger ongoing tasks that involve multiple teams.
            As our team worked closely with other teams, I learned how to communicate the details we needed
            to fix our bugs. With help from my team leader, we were able to provide other teams with the
            information necessary to fix issues on our end. Along with the other IT teams, I also talked to
            the application users/reporters to investigate the bug. There were a few times when I needed to
            send follow-up emails and I often received a quick reply. Throughout my term, some projects took
            longer than expected but I was able to complete most projects I had assigned to me that involved
            multiple teams. With the spreadsheet I used during my last work term, it was easy to keep track of
            and follow up with colleagues on what I needed to complete and pending tasks from other teams.
          </p>
          <h4 class="goalTitle">2) Information Literacy - Learn more about how the processes work at CRA.</h4>
          <p>I have been working on bigger projects which needed me to learn about how our code interacts
            with other teams. Working on multiple parts of our codebase allowed me to look at various parts
            of our application and I was assigned to look at a particular function that occurs throughout
            our program. For 2 months, I inspected the code and any current documentation to record where
            and how a certain function is invoked. Then, I converted the notes and code into a workflow diagram
            to document all the decisions that trigger that functionality. This large task improved my ability
            to analyze code and report the results in a presentable format. Along with this larger task, I have
            worked on implementing smaller features. This was easier to code and taught me how to update our
            documentation for future developers. Overall, I have completed this goal as I have learned more about
            how our application works and read through lots of documentation and code to understand some of the nuances
            in our application.</p>
          <h4 class="goalTitle">3) Problem Solving - Take on more difficult tasks that require further investigation.
          </h4>
          <p>Based on the work I have done in my previous term to learn about our systems, I have taken on more complex
            issues that involve multiple teams and workflows. Although I have been learning a lot about our codebase,
            working on larger projects took a lot more time than I expected. Compiling the data, analyzing the solution,
            testing the solution locally, executing the fix and then verifying the fix took longer than necessary with
            so
            many scenarios
            and accounts. I have been using new tools to help me with larger tasks which sometimes involved input from
            other teams and delayed the investigation process. Using the organization system I set up for myself during
            my
            last work term, I kept track of all my notes and the status of each task. This was very helpful when I was
            working on
            multiple issues at the same time and when I needed to reference older tickets. With help from my colleagues,
            I was
            able to fix more advanced tickets than in my last coop term and I plan to continue improving my
            problem-solving skills
            to fix these issues faster. <br><br>
            During my 8-month coop term at the CRA, I continued improving my technical and soft skills as a coder.
            I learned a lot while working with a large team on a Java Swing application. As I moved to work on more
            advanced issues, I had a better understanding of the analysis and design that goes into an application with help from my colleagues. Overall, my
            goals for
            this semester involved more communication and critical thinking skills which I improved upon during my time
            at CRA.

        <h4>Job Description</h4>
        <p>This term allowed me to work on more intricate parts of our application. I dug deeper through our code to
          create flowcharts that help us understand how one of our features works. This showed me how useful it is to
          have documentation and records of our changes. Along with tracing through the logic of our code, I also got
          to add new features. Adding new labels/indicators allowed users to track their progress easily and who made
          these changes. I got into some details in our code that interact with other teams and have worked with them
          to solve overlapping issues. All in all, I got to be a part of our application's design, code and testing
          portions and have learned a lot about the software development cycle in the industry.
        </p>

        <h4>Conclusion & Acknowledgements</h4>
        <p>Overall, I had an amazing second co-op term at the CRA. Working with an amazing
          team and team leader, I learned a lot about industry practices and software development.
          Thanks to my team who were supportive and helped me with the technical and business logic
          behind the features used in our application! I had a fantastic time at CRA and would love
          to return someday!</p>

        <h3>Coop Term 1 - CRA</h3>
        <p class="date">May - August 2024</p>
        <div class="border">
          <h4>About the Company</h4>
          <p>For my first coop term, I worked at the Canada Revenue Agency. As an agency under the federal government of
            Canada, the CRA is in charge of all taxes and benefits for Canadians.
          <blockquote><i>The CRA’s mission is to “Administer tax, benefits, and related programs, and ensure compliance
              on behalf of governments across Canada, thereby contributing to the ongoing economic and social well-being
              of
              Canadians.”
            </i></blockquote>
          As of May 2023, over 62,000 full-time employees were working for the agency across Canada. More specifically,
          there are 13 headquarters branches and 4 regions that make up the organizational structure of the CRA. One of
          the headquarters branches is the Informational Technology Branch (ITB) and as of February 2022, there are
          approximately 4,330 full-time employees. ITB is responsible for providing IT infrastructure for CRA delivery
          systems with the Finance and Administration Branch along with supporting all CRA employees with the tools they
          need to help Canadians. I worked in the ITB branch as an IT developer on a front-end application.

        <div class="border">
          <h4>Goals</h4>
          <p>My team works on a Java Swing application and my job involves fixing bugs on the front end. Based on my
            job, I had the following goals I wanted to accomplish before the end of my work term. My goals included
            improving my communication skills, organization skills and technological literacy. </p>
          <h4 class="goalTitle">1) Oral Communication - Improve my presentation and speaking skills.</h4>
          <p>To improve my communication skills, I became the scrum leader once a month for a week to keep track of the
            issues my team was working on. This allowed me to learn about the ongoing projects/issues and the steps we
            take to resolve them. This was valuable for me as I learned about the various roles my team members have
            (Specialist, Developer, Tester etc.) and if there are overlapping issues. As everyone on my team works
            remotely,
            our daily scrum meetings allow us to update each
            other about the tasks we are working on and if we need input from other members of the team. Being the scrum
            leader helped me take on a leadership role for the meeting, interact with all my team members, and write
            down any updates the team needs to know. Over time, I was able to better communicate with my team as I
            learned about their tasks and could ask specific and detailed questions about their work.</p>
          <h4 class="goalTitle">2) Technological Literacy - Familiarize myself with the debugger tools to investigate my
            tickets.</h4>
          <p>For technological literacy, I have learned about the various tools we use at our agency. As my team mainly
            uses Java, I have used the skills I learned from the OOP course at the University of Guelph and applied
            those principles when working on tickets. This was also the first time I contributed to a repository with
            multiple people. This experience improved my knowledge of git and git standards as tracking our changes is
            important when looking back at the old code. Although I did not work on the back end, I needed to understand
            how it connects to our front end to describe the issue with the appropriate team. Thus, I learned about how
            our weblogic server is used in our application as well as some SQL and Cobol. I also became familiar with
            the Eclipse IDE and the JIRA workflow.</p>
          <h4 class="goalTitle">3) Inquiry & Analysis - Establish a routine to diagnose the issue in the ticket.</h4>
          <p>Lastly, I also wanted to improve my organizational skills. As I had to work on multiple tickets at the same
            time, I wanted to keep track of my progress on my tickets accurately. I decided to use an Excel spreadsheet
            and record my progress in multiple places to keep track of my workflow. I used the spreadsheet to keep track
            of all my current and future tasks and what needed to be accomplished. During the scrum meeting, I would
            update the team with my current tasks and write down their deadlines. Lastly, at the end of the day, I made
            a list of all the work I completed and sent it to my team. By recording my tasks in multiple places, it was
            easy to track my progress and work on multiple issues at the same time.<br><br>
            Overall, I believe that I have accomplished all of these goals as all of the experiences above helped me
            strengthen my communication, technological literacy, and organizational skills. I hope to continue working
            on these goals and create new ones based on the new problems I am working on at the CRA for my next work
            term.

        </div>
        <h4>Job Description</h4>
        <p>My job involves fixing bugs that occur in our Java Swing application. As I have taken the OOP course and
          created a Java Swing application on my own, I have applied these skills directly to my work at the CRA. Using
          these skills on a much larger application with many connected components (weblogic, SQL, etc.) helped me learn
          about how interconnected bigger programs can become. The most interesting part of
          the project was learning about how our tax application is used and the many nuances that come up when
          creating a large application. Learning about the backend and how the taxpayer’s information
          is passed to our applications helped me understand how the consumer uses our program and the impact it has.
          Thus, coordinating my code changes with other teams, having routine
          checks,
          and communicating with clients were an important and interesting part of my job to make sure the application
          is working
          correctly. Overall, knowing that these changes will directly affect and help many Canadians makes my job
          meaningful!
        </p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Overall, I enjoyed having my first coop term at the CRA. It was a great opportunity to apply the skills I
          learned in university to a larger scale application. I have learned many hard skills (such as coding
          practices, git, using the eclipse IDE, etc.) and improved many soft skills (leading a team meeting, explaining
          bugs to other teams, organizing and tracking my work, etc.). I hope to continue improving these skills and
          learning more about the industry during my next work term wtih the CRA!
        </p>
        <h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
        <p>I would like to thank all of my team members that have helped me learn to become a developer at the CRA! They
          have answered so many of my questions and helped me learn about developer practices. I
          would also like to thank the CS coop coordinators and the SOCS program counselors for answering all of my
          questions during my first coop work term!</p>
